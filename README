Racing on Rails is an existing Rails application built by Scott Wilson of Portland, OR (http://butlerpress.com) and stored in a Subversion repository.  The application currently runs the websites of the following cycling associations:
	~ OBRA (Oregon Bicycle Racing Association) - http://obra.org
	~ WSBA (Washington State Bicycle Racing Association) - http://wsbaracing.com
	~ ATRA (American Track Racing Association) - http://raceatra.com/
	~ ABA (Alberta Bicycle Association) - http://www.albertabicycle.ab.ca/

Features include race calenders, results, and membership. Data is stored in a MySQL database.  Results can be imported from Excel spreadsheets.  Content can be managed via an admin backend.

WSBARacing is a git-svn fork with the several objectives:
	~ Provide an online registration system for events sanctioned by the cycling association.  Considering BrainTree for CC processing. Determining breakdown of fee responsibility and payout protocol.
	~ Build an off-line race results engine (with SproutCore?) that synchronizes with the existing results schema.
	~ Get the dynamic calendering feature working similar to OBRA (editable by promoters or WSBA staff?)
	~ Add a forum (here's a candidate: http://code.google.com/p/savage-beast-2/)

However these objectives will be moved to Lighthouse as Milestones (once I learn the API).
