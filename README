Racing on Rails is an existing Rails application built by Scott Wilson of Portland, OR (http://butlerpress.com) and stored in a Subversion repository.  The application currently runs the websites of the following cycling associations:
	~ OBRA (Oregon Bicycle Racing Association) - http://obra.org
	~ WSBA (Washington State Bicycle Racing Association) - http://wsbaracing.com
	~ ATRA (American Track Racing Association) - http://raceatra.com/
	~ ABA (Alberta Bicycle Association) - http://www.albertabicycle.ab.ca/

Features include race calenders, results, and membership. Data is stored in a MySQL database backend.  Results can be imported via Excel.  Content can be managed via an admin CMS.

WSBARacing is a git-svn fork with the following objectives:
	~ Provide an online registration system for events sanctioned by the cycling association.
	~ Build an off-line race results engine (with SproutCore?) that synchronizes with the existing results schema.
