Racing on Rails is an existing Rails application built by Scott Wilson of Portland, OR (http://butlerpress.com) and stored in a Subversion repository.  The application currently runs the websites of the following cycling associations: OBRA, WSBA, ATA, and ABA.  It deftly handles race calenders, results, and membership with a MySQL database backend.

WSBARacing is a git-svn fork with the following objectives:
	~ Provide an online registration system for events sanctioned by the cycling association.
	~ Build an off-line race results engine (with SproutCore?) that synchronizes with the existing results schema.
