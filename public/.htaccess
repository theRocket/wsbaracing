# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,
# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests
# 
# Example:
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*
#   RewriteRule .* - [L]

# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails
# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow
# 
# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one
#
# Example:
#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]

RewriteEngine On

# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,
# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.
#
# Example:
#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public
#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp

#   first try to find it in custom/...
#   ...and if found stop and be happy:
RewriteCond         /Users/sw/devel/racing_on_rails/obra/public/%{REQUEST_FILENAME}  -f
RewriteRule  ^(.+)  /Users/sw/devel/racing_on_rails/obra/public/$1  [L]

#   second try to find it in pub/...
#   ...and if found stop and be happy:
RewriteCond         /Users/sw/devel/racing_on_rails/public/%{REQUEST_FILENAME}  -f
RewriteRule  ^(.+)  /Users/sw/devel/racing_on_rails/public/$1  [L]

RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]

# In case Rails experiences terminal errors
# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead
# 
# Example:
#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html

ErrorDocument 500 "<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly"
