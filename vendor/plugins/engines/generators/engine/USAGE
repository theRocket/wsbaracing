Description:
  The Engine Generator creates the directories and files you need
  to create your own engine.

Example:
  ./script/generate engine MyEngine

  This will generate:
  RAILS_ROOT
    |- vendor
        |-plugins
            |- my_engine             <-- our example engine
                  |- init_engine.rb
                  |- app
                  |     |- controllers
                  |     |- model
                  |     |- helpers
                  |     |- views
                  |- db
                  |- tasks
                  |- lib
                  |- public
                  |     |- javascripts
                  |     |- stylesheets
                  |- test
