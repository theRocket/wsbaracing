= Html4ify

A plugin to help you get rid of the self-closing HTML-tags that Rails' tag helpers keep throwing at you.This is useful when you want to keep your generated HTML-code HTML 4 compliant, hence the name of the plugin.


== Usage

Use Rails' tag helpers like you're used to do. This plugin overwrites some standard methods to do its magic, you don't need to worry about a thing. In addition this plugin provides a method +doctype+ to generate a Document Type Declaration. To use it in your views, simply type:

  <%= doctype %>

This will generate a standard HTML 4.01 Strict doctype-declaration. Optionally, you can pass in an argument to specify the type op DTD, like this:

  <%= doctype :loose %>

yields:

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

and:

  <%= doctype :frameset %>
  
yields:

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
