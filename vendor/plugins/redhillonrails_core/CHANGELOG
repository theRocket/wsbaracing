[REVISION 20061011]

[NEW] ActiveRecord::Base.base_class? returns true if the class is a base class; false otherwise.

[REVISION 20061009]

[NEW] ActiveRecord::Base.abstract_class? returns true if class name starts with 'Abstract'; false otherwise.

[REVISION 20061001]

[NEW] remove_foreign_key for completeness.

[FIXED] MySQL barfs when attempting to drop a column that participates in a foreign key constraint.

[REVISION 20060921]

[FIXED] add_foreign_key doesn't support on_delete or on_update--It doesn't do anything with the options hash.

[REVISION 20060919]

[CHANGED] Column.unique is now derived based on the presence of Column.unique_scope (which is an empty array for single column unique indexes).

[REVISION 20060915]

[NEW] Unique columns contain scoping meta-data for multi-column unique indexes. The column to be marked as unique is either the last column not ending in '_id' or simply the last column. This follows the typical composite unique index column ordering where the scoping is specified first but will attempt to find the last non-foreign-key column just-in-case. Eg, both add_index :states, [:country_id, :name] and add_index :states, [:name, :country_id] would result in the name column marked as unique with a scope of [:country_id].

[REVISION 20060913]

[NEW] Column.required: returns true if a column is marked as not allowing null and has no default.

[REVISION 20060911]

[NEW] Patch rails MysqlColumn so that empty string defaults are treated as nil when a column is marked as NOT NULL. This primarily affects schema dumps incorrectly assigning a default of 0 to numbers and '' to strings when none was originally specified.

[REVISION 20060909]

[CHANGED] Renamed from Foreign Key Support.

[NEW] ActiveRecord::Base.indexes.

[REVISION 20060906]

[FIXED] :on_update with :on_delete producing invalid SQL.

[REVISION 20060905]

[NEW] Schema dumper outputs foreign keys when available.

[NEW] Foreign-key meta-data for: PostgreSQL; and MySQL. (Still needs a bit of DRY-ing up but it works which is the first step.)

[REVISION 20060901]

[FIXED] Incorrect generation of ON UPDATE/ON DELETE clauses.

[NEW] Support :restrict in ON UPDATE/ON DELETE clauses.

[NEW] Preliminary support for querying foreign-keys in PostgreSQL.

[REVISION 20060831]

[NEW] Initial version.
